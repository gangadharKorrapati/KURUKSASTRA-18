                    The Pro show is the highlight of KS. Eminent artistes who can really set the stage on fire have been a permanent feature of our pro-nights.

In a short span of 4 years, KS has shown phenomenal response and is only going to get bigger this year.With the student group and support staff we have and going by the response that the fest has received, there is no looking back.
                </p>

                    It offers unlimited opportunities to talented students who are given the limelight to enthral the buzzing crowds with mind blowing performances.Enough reason for all of you to turn up in numbers and show the world what you are made of!</p>

                    Most of us have been lucky to get all that we have ever needed, good schooling, as many clothes as we want, and needless to say, food, healthy and nourishing. But there are millions out there, who are not as fortunate as us, who do not have these amenities, which are the primary requisites of life. For them, our most humble contribution can ameliorate their lives.

                    KS Uphaar is an earnest initiative to raise funds that can directly be utilized in providing education essentials in schools in and around Trichy and Thanjavur.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kuruksastra Upahaar team has envisaged accomplishing this non-profit fundraising by having collection boxes in all the clusters and other popular hangouts in the campus. The idea behind this fund-raising is to let the poor and needy children gain something useful when we have fun. Hence, the team has decided to conduct a few fun events and the money collected will be slided to KSU. The contribution, how much ever modest can be made, with a complete idea of how every penny of it is eventually going to be put to use.</p>
                <p>
                    If foregoing a burger or cold coffee can bring a smile on a thousand faces, is it not worth it? As they say, children are our future, let us be a small ray of hope in the beam of light that they need to establish a bright tomorrow. Join KS Upahaar!!
